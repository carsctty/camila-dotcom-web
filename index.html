<h2: Billie Jean” – Michael Jackson (1982)

There’s a reason “Billie Jean” still fills dance floors decades later. The bassline alone could carry the whole track, but Jackson’s performance turns it into pure magic — mysterious, rhythmic, and almost hypnotic. The song captures both fame’s thrill and paranoia, wrapped in that signature 80s groove. It’s the definition of timeless pop perfection.</h2>
<p> Hotel California” – Eagles (1976)

“Hotel California” feels like stepping into a dream that slowly becomes a nightmare. The lyrics are poetic and unsettling, symbolizing excess and illusion in American life. And that guitar solo — layered, emotional, iconic — is one of the best ever recorded. This song isn’t just rock history; it’s storytelling at its most haunting. </p>

<h2> “What’s Going On” – Marvin Gaye (1971)

While some songs age, this one only grows more relevant. Marvin Gaye’s voice floats over soft horns and soulful rhythm, asking hard questions about war, inequality, and peace. It’s both protest and prayer — emotional, thoughtful, and beautifully arranged. Listening today feels like hearing a plea for empathy that the world still needs.</h2>
